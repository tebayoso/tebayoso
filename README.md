# Hi, I'm Jorge de los Santos! 👋

### Software Architect | Platform Engineer | Blockchain Developer

As a seasoned software engineer and blockchain enthusiast, I've spent years navigating the complexities of Web3 and blockchain technologies. My journey includes pivotal roles at **Euler Tools**, **Certchain**, **Michelin**, and **Uttopion**, where I've honed my skills in full-stack development, DevOps, and leading innovative tech projects.

My passion lies in bridging the gap between cutting-edge blockchain solutions and practical, real-world applications. I'm all about building technology that matters—technology that reshapes how we interact with the digital world. In my repositories, you'll find a mix of projects showcasing my journey in Web3, from decentralized applications (DApps) to data-driven blockchain platforms.

I love collaborating and am always open to connecting with like-minded enthusiasts and professionals. Feel free to reach out for collaborations or just a chat about the latest in tech!
