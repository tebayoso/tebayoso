<h2>Hi, I'm Jorge de los Santos!</h2>
<h3>Software Architect | Platform Engineer | Blockchain Developer</h3>

Hello üëã, I'm Jorge de los Santos!

As a seasoned software engineer and blockchain enthusiast, I've spent years navigating the complexities of Web3 and blockchain technologies. My journey includes pivotal roles at Euler Tools, Certchain, Michelin, and Uttopion, where I've honed my skills in full-stack development, DevOps, and leading innovative tech projects.

My passion lies in bridging the gap between cutting-edge blockchain solutions and practical, real-world applications. I'm all about building technology that matters - technology that reshapes how we interact with the digital world. In my repositories, you'll find a mix of projects showcasing my journey in Web3, from decentralized applications (DApps) to data-driven blockchain platforms.

I love collaborating and am always open to connecting with like-minded enthusiasts and professionals. Feel free to reach out for collaborations or just a chat about the latest in blockchain tech!

Happy coding!
